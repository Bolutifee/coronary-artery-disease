                    Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is a condition characterized by the narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries, 
                    which supply blood to the heart muscle. This restriction is primarily caused by atherosclerosis, a buildup of fatty deposits, 
                    cholesterol, and other substances on the artery walls. Contributing factors include genetic predisposition, high blood pressure, 
                    high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, and lifestyle choices such as poor diet and lack of exercise. Early detection through screening 
                    and effective management strategies, including lifestyle changes, medications, and procedures like angioplasty or coronary artery 
                    bypass surgery, are crucial for reducing the risk of heart attacks and improving overall cardiovascular health.

                    Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on developing algorithms that allow computers to learn 
                    from and make decisions based on data. The process begins with collecting data, which is split into training, and test sets. Algorithms such as linear 
                    regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks analyze this data to identify patterns and make predictions. 
                    In healthcare, machine learning is particularly useful for predicting diseases like coronary artery disease (CAD). By analyzing 
                    patient data such as demographics, medical history, and lab resultsâ€”machine learning models can classify the likelihood of CAD or 
                    estimate its severity.

                            The first coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in 1960 and the subsequent development of percutaneous coronary 
                            intervention (PCI) revolutionized the treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD) (Doenst et al, 2022). Treatment 
                            options for CAD vary based on disease severity and patient symptoms, including medications, surgical procedures, 
                            and lifestyle changes. Medications such as aspirin, statins, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers lower 
                            cholesterol, manage blood pressure, and prevent blood clots. When medications are insufficient, surgical options 
                            like angioplasty and stenting, CABG, and, in severe cases, heart transplants are considered. Angioplasty opens 
                            blocked arteries, sometimes with stent placement, while CABG uses a healthy vessel to bypass blockages. Lifestyle 
                            changes, including a heart-healthy diet, regular exercise, quitting smoking, and managing stress, are vital for 
                            improving cardiovascular health (Bansal et al, 2023). Treatment choice depends on blockage location, severity, 
                            overall health, and other medical conditions.

                            The web application facilitates the early detection and classification of coronary artery disease (CAD) using machine 
                            learning algorithms. It features two primary forms for user interaction. In the first form, users enter patient details 
                            such as age, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. Upon clicking the "Predict" button, the application analyzes the 
                            data using a machine learning model to determine if the patient has CAD, displaying the result instantly. 
                            The second form helps determine the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy. Users provide additional health 
                            information, and the application predicts the number of affected vessels using a specialized model. The result is displayed 
                            immediately, aiding in further clinical decision-making. 
                            Additionally, the web app educates users on the causes, prevention, and treatment options for CAD. This app aims to enhance 
                            CAD diagnosis and management by providing quick, accurate predictions, supporting early intervention, and improving patient 
                            outcomes while also increasing awareness and knowledge about the disease.

                            Heart cancer, also known as primary cardiac tumor, is an extremely rare condition. Malignant tumors 
                            originating in the heart are uncommon, with the majority of heart tumors being noncancerous. Due to 
                            its rarity, heart cancer has limited scientific research and understanding. The treatment strategies 
                            for heart cancer are not well-established due to its uncommon occurrence. In cases of primary cardiac 
                            tumors, surgical removal of the tumor is typically performed. For malignant or metastatic tumors, a 
                            combination of surgical intervention, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy may be considered. Given the 
                            limited knowledge about heart cancer, it is crucial to consult with healthcare professionals who 
                            specialize in cardiac conditions for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment options. 
                            Collaborative discussions between the patient, oncologists, and cardiologists are essential to develop 
                            an individualized treatment plan. As heart cancer remains an exceedingly rare condition, continued 
                            research efforts are needed to improve our understanding and develop more targeted treatment approaches.

                            Lung cancer is a complex disease that involves the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the lungs. 
                            It is primarily categorized into two main types: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell 
                            lung cancer (SCLC). NSCLC accounts for the majority of cases and includes subtypes such as adenocarcinoma, 
                            squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. SCLC is less common but tends to grow and spread more 
                            rapidly. The development of lung cancer is influenced by various genetic and molecular factors. Mutations 
                            in specific genes, such as EGFR, ALK, KRAS, and ROS1, play a significant role in the initiation and progression 
                            of lung cancer. Other factors, including environmental exposures like tobacco smoke, air pollution, and occupational 
                            hazards, contribute to the risk. Advancements in research have led to targeted therapies and immunotherapies that 
                            specifically target the altered molecules and pathways driving lung cancer growth. Precision medicine approaches 
                            aim to match treatments with the genetic profiles of individual tumors, allowing for more effective and 
                            personalized interventions. Ongoing studies continue to unravel the complexities of lung cancer, leading to 
                            improved understanding and innovative approaches to treatment.
