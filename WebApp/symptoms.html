                    Recognizing the symptoms of coronary artery disease (CAD) is crucial for early detection and 
                    treatment, reducing the risk of severe cardiovascular events and improving patient outcomes. 
                    Awareness of these symptoms enables timely medical intervention, enhancing quality of life and 
                    potentially lowering healthcare costs.

                    A heart attack can be the first indication of CAD for some individuals. This occurs when a coronary artery 
                    becomes completely blocked, leading to symptoms like severe chest pain or pressure, pain in the shoulder or 
                    arm, shortness of breath, and sweating. However, some heart attacks can happen without noticeable signs or 
                    symptoms. Heart palpitations, feeling like the heart is pounding, racing, or skipping beats, may also occur. 
                    While infrequent and brief palpitations are often not a concern, persistent or severe palpitations should be 
                    evaluated. Occasionally, chest pain may be accompanied by vomiting, indigestion, or nausea, which can be 
                    mistaken for other medical issues such as acid reflux. Recognizing these symptoms is crucial for timely diagnosis 
                    and treatment of CAD.

                    The symptoms of coronary artery disease (CAD) can vary widely depending on the severity of the condition. 
                    Some individuals may not exhibit any symptoms, while others might experience a range of signs. One common 
                    symptom is chest pain, known as angina. This pain can feel like pressure or tightness, often described as 
                    having someone standing on your chest. Angina usually occurs in the middle or left side of the chest and 
                    may be triggered by physical activity or intense emotions. The discomfort typically subsides within minutes 
                    after the triggering event ends. In some cases, particularly in women, the pain can be brief and sharp, 
                    extending to the neck, arm, or back (Mayo Clinic, 2022). Another symptom is shortness of breath, which may 
                    accompany chest discomfort and give a sensation of not being able to catch your breath. Fatigue is also a 
                    common sign, indicating that the heart might not be pumping enough blood to meet the body's needs.

                <p>
                    The treatment of breast cancer depends on several factors, including the stage of the cancer, the 
                    presence of specific receptors, and the patient's overall health. Common treatment options include 
                    surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and hormone therapy. Surgery is often 
                    the primary treatment and involves removing the tumor and surrounding tissue. This may include 
                    lumpectomy (removal of the tumor and a small margin of healthy tissue) or mastectomy (removal of the entire breast). 
                    Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays or other radiation sources to destroy cancer cells or shrink tumors. 
                    Chemotherapy utilizes drugs to kill cancer cells throughout the body, often administered intravenously. 
                    Targeted therapy focuses on specific molecular characteristics of cancer cells and uses drugs to block their 
                    growth and spread. Hormone therapy is used when breast cancer cells have receptors for estrogen or progesterone 
                    and aims to reduce hormone levels or block their effects. The treatment plan is individualized based on the specific 
                    characteristics of the cancer and the patient's preferences and may involve a combination of these treatment modalities.
